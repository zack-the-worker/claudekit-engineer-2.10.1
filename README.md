# Claude Code Boilerplate

A comprehensive boilerplate template for building professional software projects with **CLI Coding Agents** (**Claude Code** and **Open Code**). This template provides a complete development environment with AI-powered agent orchestration, automated workflows, and intelligent project management.

## What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code** is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings AI-powered development assistance directly to your terminal. It enables natural language interaction with your codebase and provides intelligent automation for common development tasks.

- **Semantic Versioning**: Version numbers follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Conventional Commits**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format for automatic changelog generation
- **GitHub Releases**: Releases are automatically created on GitHub with generated changelogs
- **NPM Publishing**: Optional - can be enabled by setting `npmPublish: true` in `.releaserc.json` and adding NPM_TOKEN secret

### Commit Message Format

```bash
# Features (minor version bump)
feat: add new authentication system

# Bug fixes (patch version bump)
fix: resolve memory leak in user service

# Breaking changes (major version bump)
feat!: redesign API endpoints
# or

This boilerplate includes specialized AI agents that work together to deliver high-quality software:

### 🎯 Core Development Agents

#### **Planner Agent**
- Researches technical approaches and best practices
- Creates comprehensive implementation plans
- Analyzes architectural trade-offs
- Spawns multiple researcher agents for parallel investigation

#### **Researcher Agent**
- Investigates specific technologies and frameworks
- Analyzes existing solutions and patterns
- Provides technical recommendations
- Supports the planner with detailed findings

#### **Tester Agent**
- Generates comprehensive test suites
- Validates functionality and performance
- Ensures cross-platform compatibility
- Reports on test coverage and quality metrics

- Enforces coding standards and conventions
- Identifies security vulnerabilities
- Provides improvement recommendations

#### **Debugger Agent**
- Analyzes application logs and error reports
- Diagnoses performance bottlenecks
- Investigates CI/CD pipeline issues

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Chaining
Use when tasks have dependencies:
```bash
# Planning → Implementation → Testing → Review
/plan "implement user dashboard"
# Wait for plan completion, then:
/cook "follow the implementation plan"
# After implementation:
/test "validate dashboard functionality"
# Finally:
/review "ensure code quality standards"
```

### Parallel Execution
Use for independent tasks:
```bash
# Multiple researchers exploring different approaches
planner agent spawns:
- researcher (database options)
- researcher (authentication methods)
- researcher (UI frameworks)
# All report back to planner simultaneously
```

### Context Management
- Agents communicate through file system reports
- Context is preserved between agent handoffs
- Fresh context prevents conversation degradation
- Essential information is documented in markdown

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development
```bash
# Start with planning
/plan "add real-time notifications"

# Research phase (automatic)
# Multiple researcher agents investigate approaches

# Implementation
/cook "implement notification system"

# Quality assurance
/test
/review

# Documentation update
/docs

# Project tracking
/watzup  # Check project status
```

### 2. Bug Fixing
```bash
# Analyze the issue
/debug "investigate login failures"

# Create fix plan
/plan "resolve authentication bug"

# Implement solution
/fix "authentication issue"

# Validate fix
/test
```

### 3. Documentation Management
```bash
# Update documentation
/docs

# Generate codebase summary
repomix  # Creates ./docs/codebase-summary.md

# Review project status
/watzup
```

- **gemini-image-gen** - AI image generation
- **gemini-vision** - Image analysis and vision capabilities

### API Key Setup

The Gemini skills check for `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the following order (priority from highest to lowest):

1. **Environment Variable** (Recommended for development)
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

2. **Project Root `.env`** (Recommended for project-specific keys)
   ```bash
   # Create .env in project root
   echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here' > .env
   ```

3. **`.claude/.env`** (For Claude-specific configuration)
   ```bash
   # Copy example and edit
   cp .claude/.env.example .claude/.env
   # Then edit .claude/.env and set your API key
   ```

4. **`.claude/skills/.env`** (For shared skills configuration)
   ```bash
   # Copy example and edit
   cp .claude/skills/.env.example .claude/skills/.env
   # Then edit .claude/skills/.env and set your API key
   ```

5. **Individual Skill Directory `.env`** (For skill-specific keys)
   ```bash
   # Example for gemini-audio skill
   cp .claude/skills/gemini-audio/.env.example .claude/skills/gemini-audio/.env
   # Then edit and set your API key
   ```

### Getting Your API Key
