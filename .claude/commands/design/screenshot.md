argument-hint: [screenshot]
---

Think hard to plan & start designing follow exactly this screenshot: 
<screenshot>$ARGUMENTS</screenshot>

## Workflow:
1. Use `eyes` analyze tool to describe super details of the screenshot (design style, trends, fonts, colors, border, spacing, elements' positions, size, shape, texture, material, light, shadow, reflection, refraction, blur, glow, image, background transparency, transition, etc.)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Try to predict the font name (Google Fonts) and font size in the given screenshot, don't just use Inter or Poppins.
2. Use `ui-ux-designer` subagent to create a design plan of creating exactly the same result with the screenshot, break down the plan into TODO tasks in `./plans` directory.
3. Then implement the plan step by step.
4. If user doesn't specify, create the design in pure HTML/CSS/JS.
5. Report back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, ask user to review the changes and approve them.
6. If user approves the changes, update the `./docs/design-guidelines.md` docs if needed.

## Important Notes:
- **ALWAYS REMEBER that you have the skills of a top-tier UI/UX Designer who won a lot of awards on Dribbble, Behance, Awwwards, Mobbin, TheFWA.**
- Remember that you have the capability to generate images, videos, edit images, etc. with gemini-image-gen skill for image generation. Use them to create the design with real assets.
- Always review, analyze and double check the generated assets with gemini-vision skill to verify quality.
- Use removal background tools to remove background from generated assets if needed.
- Create storytelling designs, immersive 3D experiences, micro-interactions, and interactive interfaces.
- Maintain and update `./docs/design-guidelines.md` docs if needed.
